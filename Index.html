		  <summary>Programmer challenges to use each model</summary>
		  <div class="content">
			<h2>1. Python</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Slower for CPU-Intensive Tasks:</strong> Python is slower compared to lower-level languages like C or C++.</li>
			  <li><strong>The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):</strong> Limits true parallelism in multi-threaded, CPU-bound tasks.</li>
			  <li><strong>Dynamic Typing Pitfalls:</strong> Type mismatch errors only appear at runtime, making debugging harder.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>2. JavaScript</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Fragmented Ecosystem and Tooling:</strong> Rapidly changing libraries and frameworks can lead to “JavaScript fatigue.”</li>
			  <li><strong>Browser Inconsistencies:</strong> Different browsers have historically implemented JavaScript features differently.</li>
			  <li><strong>Asynchronous Complexity:</strong> Handling callbacks, promises, and async/await properly can be tricky.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>3. Java</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Verbose Syntax:</strong> Boilerplate code (getters, setters, etc.) and class-based structure can feel heavy compared to more concise languages.</li>
			  <li><strong>Long Startup Times and Memory Usage:</strong> The JVM can have higher memory overhead, and startup can be slower than compiled languages like C++ or Rust.</li>
			  <li><strong>Backward Compatibility and Legacy Code:</strong> Maintaining older codebases can mean dealing with large amounts of legacy infrastructure and libraries.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>4. C</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Manual Memory Management:</strong> Managing memory (malloc, free) and dealing with pointers can be error-prone, leading to memory leaks or segmentation faults.</li>
			  <li><strong>Lack of Modern Abstractions:</strong> No built-in object orientation, generics, or advanced language features found in newer languages.</li>
			  <li><strong>Debugging Complexity:</strong> Diagnosing pointer and buffer overflow errors can be challenging, especially in large codebases.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>5. C++</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Complex Language Features:</strong> Templates, multiple inheritance, operator overloading, and other advanced features add complexity.</li>
			  <li><strong>Long Compile Times:</strong> Big C++ projects can have significant build times due to templates and header inclusion.</li>
			  <li><strong>Manual Resource Management:</strong> Although smart pointers help, memory management issues can still occur.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>6. C#</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Platform/Framework Lock-In (Historically):</strong> Originally tied heavily to the Windows ecosystem; although .NET is now open source and cross-platform, many older projects are still Windows-centric.</li>
			  <li><strong>Large Frameworks and Versions:</strong> The .NET environment has various versions and frameworks (Framework vs .NET Core vs .NET 5/6+), which can lead to confusion or compatibility issues.</li>
			  <li><strong>Resource Requirements:</strong> Like Java, C# applications running on .NET can have higher memory footprints compared to native languages like C or C++.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>7. PHP</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Inconsistent Language Design:</strong> Historically, function naming and parameter orders can feel inconsistent (e.g., array_filter, array_map, etc.).</li>
			  <li><strong>Performance and Security Concerns:</strong> Older versions of PHP were less efficient. Security best practices often weren’t followed in legacy code (e.g., outdated tutorials).</li>
			  <li><strong>Reliance on Shared Hosting:</strong> A positive (easy deployment) can also be a negative when dealing with older or restricted hosting environments.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>8. Ruby</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Performance Constraints:</strong> Generally slower compared to compiled languages or even some other interpreted languages (like newer versions of Python with JITs).</li>
			  <li><strong>Concurrency Model:</strong> Ruby’s “green threads” in MRI (CRuby) can limit true parallelism. Alternative implementations (JRuby) exist but are less common.</li>
			  <li><strong>Evolving Versions and Smaller Ecosystem (Outside of Rails):</strong> Ruby is heavily associated with Rails; outside that framework, it’s less prevalent.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>9. Swift</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Evolving Language:</strong> Swift has had frequent and sometimes breaking changes, especially in its early years, leading to version compatibility issues.</li>
			  <li><strong>Apple Ecosystem Lock-In:</strong> Primarily used for iOS and macOS; although it’s open source and can run on Linux, it’s still largely driven by Apple’s platform development.</li>
			  <li><strong>Limited Cross-Platform Support:</strong> Outside of Apple platforms, Swift adoption is still comparatively small.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>10. Kotlin</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Ecosystem Not as Mature as Java (Yet):</strong> While Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, some libraries and tools are still Java-centric, or have incomplete Kotlin DSLs.</li>
			  <li><strong>Slower Compilation Times (Compared to Java):</strong> Kotlin’s more advanced features (like inline functions, lambdas) sometimes introduce extra compile-time overhead.</li>
			  <li><strong>Learning Curve from Java:</strong> Though Kotlin is simpler in many respects, developers used to Java’s verbosity need time to adapt.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>11. Go (Golang)</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Minimalism Can Be Restrictive:</strong> Lack of generics (pre-Go 1.18) meant more repetitive code. Even with generics now, the design is intentionally simplified, which may feel limiting for some.</li>
			  <li><strong>Error Handling Verbosity:</strong> Go relies heavily on explicit error checks (e.g., if err != nil) which can feel cumbersome.</li>
			  <li><strong>Concurrency Pitfalls:</strong> Goroutines are easy to start but can be overlooked in terms of resource usage, leading to potential memory leaks if not managed properly.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>12. Rust</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Steep Learning Curve:</strong> The borrow checker and strict type system can be difficult for beginners or developers coming from garbage-collected languages.</li>
			  <li><strong>Long Compilation Times:</strong> Rust’s compiler does extensive checks, which results in safer code but slower build times, especially for large projects.</li>
			  <li><strong>Relatively Young Ecosystem:</strong> While growing quickly, Rust does not have the decades of libraries that languages like C/C++ or Java do, so certain domains may still have limited library support.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>13. TypeScript</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Configuration Complexity:</strong> Requires a build/compile step (tsconfig.json), which can be daunting for newcomers.</li>
			  <li><strong>Definition Files for Third-Party JS Libraries:</strong> Even though DefinitelyTyped helps with type definitions, mismatched or incomplete typings can cause friction.</li>
			  <li><strong>Advanced Type Features Are Complex:</strong> Generics, mapped types, and advanced type utilities can become very complicated, making type errors difficult to debug.</li>

		  <summary>The roadmap to create a new programming language</summary>
		  <div class="content">
			<h2>1. Define Your Core Philosophy and Goals</h2>
			<h3>Identify the Problems You Want to Solve</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>What shortcomings in current languages do you want to address?</li>
			  <li>
				Common challenges might include:
				<ul>
				  <li>Memory safety without too much complexity (Rust vs. C++).</li>
				  <li>Clear, minimal syntax (Go’s simplicity vs. complex, highly flexible languages).</li>
				  <li>Ease of concurrency (Go’s goroutines, Erlang/Elixir’s actor model).</li>
				  <li>Better tooling and package management from the start.</li>
				</ul>
			  </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Decide on Your Main Use Cases</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Will this language be for systems programming, web development, scripting, data science, or general-purpose use?</li>
			  <li>Defining a domain helps keep your design focused.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>2. Shape the Language Design</h2>
			<h3>Syntax Choices</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Will it be curly-brace style (like C, Java, Go)?</li>
			  <li>Indentation-based (like Python)?</li>
			  <li>Expression-oriented vs. statement-oriented?</li>
			  <li>Balancing readability, familiarity, and innovation is key.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Type System</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Static vs. Dynamic Typing:</strong> Static typing can catch errors at compile time (like TypeScript, Rust), while dynamic typing allows rapid prototyping (like Python, Ruby).</li>
			  <li><strong>Type Inference:</strong> Many modern languages (e.g., Kotlin, Rust) use type inference to reduce boilerplate.</li>
			  <li><strong>Null Safety:</strong> Minimizing or eliminating null references with language-level features (like Kotlin’s `?` or Rust’s `Option`).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Memory Management</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Manual (like C/C++), Garbage Collection (like Java/C#), Reference Counting (like Swift/Objective-C), or a Hybrid approach?</li>
			  <li>If you want high performance and safety, consider borrowing ideas from Rust’s ownership model.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Concurrency Model</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Threads and Locks (traditional), Channels/Goroutines (Go), Actors (Erlang/Elixir), or Async/Await (JavaScript, .NET).</li>
			  <li>Choose a model that fits your core domain.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Error Handling</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Exceptions (like Java, Python).</li>
			  <li>Result Types (like Rust’s Result, Go’s error returns).</li>
			  <li>Or a hybrid approach.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Standard Library Scope</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Decide how “batteries-included” the language should be.</li>
			  <li>Python includes a huge standard library, while Go is minimalist but includes robust concurrency features.</li>
			  <li>A large standard library can bootstrap adoption, but also requires significant maintenance.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>3. Build an Initial Prototype and Compiler/Interpreter</h2>
			<h3>Implement a Minimal Subset</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Start with the core syntax, a basic type system, and minimal standard libraries.</li>
			  <li>Prove your language concept works before adding more features.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Choose a Strategy: Compiler or Interpreter</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>A compiler can generate machine code or target a known VM (e.g., LLVM IR, JVM, .NET CLR).</li>
			  <li>An interpreter can be easier to get off the ground but may need a just-in-time (JIT) compiler or optimizations later for performance.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Leverage Existing Toolchains</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Using LLVM, for example, can greatly simplify the backend development.</li>
			  <li>Tapping into existing ecosystems (like the JVM, .NET) can give your language immediate cross-platform support and libraries.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>4. Create First-Class Tooling and Package Management</h2>
			<h3>Package Manager and Build Tool</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Look at Cargo (Rust), npm (JavaScript), pip (Python) for inspiration.</li>
			  <li>Automatic dependency resolution, versioning, and reproducible builds are crucial for developer adoption.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Formatting and Linting</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Emulate Go’s go fmt, Rust’s rustfmt, or Prettier for JavaScript to enforce consistent code style.</li>
			  <li>Provide official or community-driven linters to encourage best practices.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>IDE/Editor Integration</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration ensures features like autocompletion, code navigation, and refactoring in popular editors (VSCode, IntelliJ, etc.).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Testing Framework</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Offer a built-in testing framework or make it easy to develop and use third-party libraries.</li>
			  <li>Emphasize simplicity (like Go’s builtin testing package) or flexibility (like Python’s unittest/pytest ecosystem).</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>5. Gather Feedback Early (Community Building)</h2>
			<h3>Open Source Your Language</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Open collaboration encourages contributions and fosters a user community.</li>
			  <li>Transparency helps developers trust the direction of your project.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Early Adopters and Beta Testers</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Identify teams or individuals willing to try your language in real-world scenarios.</li>
			  <li>Gather feedback on what’s working, what’s confusing, and what’s missing.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Documentation and Tutorials</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Thorough, friendly documentation lowers the barrier to entry.</li>
			  <li>Clear examples, quick-start guides, and “getting started” tutorials help build adoption.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>6. Iterate, Polish, and Stabilize</h2>
			<h3>Refine the Language Specification</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Lock down the core syntax and semantics to prevent instability.</li>
			  <li>Use a clear versioning strategy (e.g., semver or language epochs like Rust) to handle breaking changes.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Establish a Roadmap</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Identify which features will be experimental, which are stable, and what is on the horizon.</li>
			  <li>Communicate clearly with the community about priorities and timelines.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Focus on Developer Experience (DX)</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Errors and warnings from the compiler/interpreter should be clear and actionable (Rust’s compiler messages are often praised for this).</li>
			  <li>Invest in a robust standard library or strong guidelines for third-party library authors.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Performance and Benchmarking</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Continuously optimize common patterns.</li>
			  <li>Compare your language’s performance and memory usage to other solutions in your target domain.</li>
			  <li>Provide official benchmarks to highlight improvements over time.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>7. Grow the Ecosystem</h2>
			<h3>Community-Driven Packages</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Encourage third-party package development for popular use cases.</li>
			  <li>Offer incentives (like official recognition or easy discoverability) for quality libraries.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Real-World Adoption Stories</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Showcase companies or open-source projects using your language in production.</li>
			  <li>Success stories inspire others to adopt and trust the language.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Conferences and Meetups</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Host or sponsor events, talks, and workshops to build user engagement.</li>
			  <li>Share best practices, case studies, and future goals with the community.</li>
			</ul>

			<summary>The suggested language and the path forward</summary>
			  <div class="content">
					<h2>1. Is It Even Possible?</h2>
					<p>Short answer: Yes, it’s possible in principle, but there are trade-offs:</p>
					<ul>
					  <li><strong>Natural Language Parsing Is Hard:</strong> Human language is ambiguous. For example:
						<div class="code-block">
				<pre><code>Sort the list and print each item</code></pre>
						</div>
						Does the user want ascending or descending order? Should duplicates be removed?
					  </li>
					  <li><strong>Context and Intent Understanding:</strong> The compiler or interpreter would need a robust way to handle incomplete or ambiguous commands. Traditional compilers expect precise syntax. A “prompt-like” language might rely on advanced parsing (potentially AI-based or rule-based) to disambiguate intent.</li>
					  <li><strong>Simplicity vs. Power:</strong> A super-simple syntax might limit how complex a program can get. Once you need more advanced logic (e.g., concurrency, database connections, or error handling), you risk drifting away from “natural” statements and into “programming constructs.”</li>
					</ul>
					<p>However, we already see partial successes of this concept with domain-specific languages (DSLs) and “low-code” or “no-code” tools. These frameworks let users configure business logic with minimal syntax. So, in a sense, it’s not only possible but already happening in certain niches—just not usually labeled as a general-purpose “programming language.”</p>

					<h2>2. Key Considerations for a “Prompt-Like” Language</h2>
					<h3>Syntax vs. Natural Language</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li><strong>Minimal, English-like Syntax:</strong> You might define statements such as:
						<div class="code-block">
				<pre><code>read file "data.csv" into dataset
				sort dataset by column "Name"
				print dataset</code></pre>
						</div>
					  </li>
					  <li><strong>Grammar and Parsing:</strong> You’d need a carefully designed grammar to interpret these lines. This grammar might be more flexible than typical languages, but still needs structure:
						<ul>
						  <li>Verb → Noun → Optional parameters.</li>
						  <li>For instance: <code>read [resource] ["identifier"] [into variable]</code>.</li>
						</ul>
					  </li>
					  <li><strong>Disambiguation Mechanisms:</strong> When ambiguous, the parser may:
						<ul>
						  <li>Prompt the user for clarification, or</li>
						  <li>Use a “best guess” approach (e.g., default to ascending order on sort).</li>
						</ul>
					  </li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Error Handling and Feedback</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li><strong>Compiler Warnings in Plain English:</strong> If the compiler can’t parse a statement or sees a logical error, it might respond with something like:
						<div class="code-block">
				<pre><code>I see you tried to print a dataset called ‘datset’. Did you mean ‘dataset’?</code></pre>
						</div>
					  </li>
					  <li><strong>Interactive Shell vs. Static Compiler:</strong> An interactive REPL or shell might better serve a prompt-like language because it can ask clarifying questions in real-time.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Performance and Resource Usage</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li><strong>Simplicity in Implementation:</strong> A language that uses a straightforward AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing approach can be efficient. You don’t necessarily need a huge runtime or advanced JIT compiler.</li>
					  <li><strong>Limit the Scope of the Language:</strong> Avoid implementing complex features like concurrency, heavy libraries, or sophisticated reflection if you aim to minimize resource usage. A smaller runtime footprint means less overhead.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Potential Use of AI</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li><strong>Optional AI-Driven Parsing:</strong> A large language model (LLM) or rule-based NLP engine could interpret ambiguous statements. But this might introduce heavier resource usage and dependence on an external service (unless you use a very optimized on-device model).</li>
					  <li><strong>Offline, Lean Implementation:</strong> Alternatively, a deterministic, rule-based parser can remain lightweight, but you lose some of the “magical” intelligence AI can provide.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>3. Conceptual Example</h2>
					<p>Let’s imagine you define a file named <code>hello.world</code> that contains:</p>
					<div class="code-block">
				<pre><code>say "Hello, World!"
				ask "What is your name?" and store answer in username
				say "Nice to meet you, {username}!"</code></pre>
					</div>
					<p>How does the language handle this?</p>
					<ul>
					  <li><strong>Lexical Analysis:</strong> It identifies tokens like <code>say</code>, <code>ask</code>, <code>store</code>, and strings.</li>
					  <li><strong>Parsing:</strong> It matches statements to grammar rules. For example:
						<ul>
						  <li><code>say "&lt;message&gt;"</code></li>
						  <li><code>ask "&lt;prompt&gt;" and store answer in &lt;variable&gt;</code></li>
						</ul>
					  </li>
					  <li><strong>Execution:</strong>
						<ul>
						  <li><code>say</code> prints the string to stdout.</li>
						  <li><code>ask</code> displays a prompt, reads input, assigns it to <code>username</code>.</li>
						  <li>The second <code>say</code> uses interpolation to print the user’s name.</li>
						</ul>
					  </li>
					</ul>
					<p>This might look like a “prompt-based” DSL. It’s very close to natural language but still restricted to a set of known patterns.</p>

					<h2>4. How to Keep It Simple but Powerful</h2>
					<h3>Limit the Language Scope</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li>Focus on a narrow domain (e.g., file I/O, text manipulation, basic logic and conditionals). This ensures you don’t blow up complexity with thousands of features.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Provide Good Defaults</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li>Whenever the user doesn’t specify details (like sort order), default to something reasonable (e.g., ascending, or lexicographical). This reduces the amount of syntax a user must learn.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Gradual Complexity</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li>Let advanced users opt into more “programming-like” constructs (loops, functions, conditionals). Keep them in plain-English style but well-defined:
						<div class="code-block">
				<pre><code>for each item in item_list
				   say "Item: {item}"
				end</code></pre>
						</div>
					  </li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Interactive Documentation</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li>Provide “built-in help” or a REPL that explains commands, like a mini-tutorial.</li>
					  <li>Example: Typing <code>help say</code> prints usage examples.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>5. Potential Challenges</h2>
					<ul>
					  <li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> Natural language often has multiple interpretations. You’ll need to systematically handle or reduce ambiguity (e.g., “sort the list by name ascending” vs. “sort the list by name, ascending or descending?”).</li>
					  <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> As projects grow bigger, you may need modules, packages, or some method to structure code. Maintaining a “prompt-like” style could become unwieldy.</li>
					  <li><strong>Performance Trade-Offs:</strong> If you rely on AI-based parsing, you might introduce large model dependencies or external APIs. A purely rule-based approach is simpler but might feel “less intelligent.”</li>
					  <li><strong>Community Adoption:</strong> Any new language faces the challenge of building an ecosystem of libraries, documentation, and tooling. Without these, it’s hard to gain traction.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>6. Path Forward: A Feasible Strategy</h2>
					<ul>
					  <li><strong>Draft a Small Grammar:</strong> Start with a few key verbs: read, write, ask, say, calculate, sort, etc. Let them combine with natural-sounding phrases: <code>read file "data.csv" into dataset</code>.</li>
					  <li><strong>Implement a Lightweight Interpreter:</strong> A simple parser that translates each statement into internal actions. Keep it in memory with minimal data structures, ensuring it’s not resource-heavy.</li>
					  <li><strong>Offer an Interactive REPL:</strong> Let users type commands one by one. Provide immediate feedback or error messages in plain English.</li>
					  <li><strong>Gather User Feedback:</strong> See where users stumble or want more capabilities. Gradually refine or expand the grammar.</li>
					  <li><strong>Expand as Needed, Keep the Core Simple:</strong> Possibly add modules for specialized tasks (e.g., HTTP requests, database queries), each with their own small set of natural commands.</li>
